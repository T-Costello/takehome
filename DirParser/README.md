Challenge: A directory contains multiple files and directories of non-uniform file and directory names. Create a program that traverses a base directory and creates an index file that can be used to quickly lookup files by name, size, and content type.

# Usage
This is a console application.  Open DirParser.sln and compile in visual studio code or community.

The Program outputs instructions.  If you don't specify a directory, it expects "test_data" to be in the same directory it is executing in.  You can also specify any 
custom path.

Follow the onscreen prompts for search types.  i.e.
Name=sample
Type=jpg
Size=>17000

It executes in a loop until "exit" is typed followed by enter.
